## Manager Tools

### What it is

Manager Tools is an app console whose intention is to automate common maintainer tasks encountered while
maintaining a github repository. These tasks can be done manually via git perhaps or even using the browser
to open pull-requests. There are even tools like `hub` that allow you to do that from the command line.
However, Manager Tools goes beyond this in that it would allow you to for instance create a Pull Request with
a formatted table description of the changes, create github release notes, change the base branch of a Pull
Request so that it can be merged to the right base, among others.

Warning: Under very heavy development!
