## Manager Tools

### What is this?

Manager Tools is an app console whose intention is to automate common maintainer tasks.

- create a Pull Request with a formatted table description of the changes
- create github release notes
- change the base branch of a Pull Request
- automate retrieval of issue's message, title and comments as a text
- merge a PR with just the number and include all github discussion on the commit message
- tagging signing off, change branch name and some queue of common tasks

Warning: Under very heavy development!
